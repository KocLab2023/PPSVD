# Privacy-Preserving Singular Value Decomposition using Fully Homomorphic Encryption
This project implements matrix computations in the encrypted domain using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme, including the Power Method and the spectral shifting method. 
The objective is to perform iterative linear transformations, normalization, and inner/outer product operations on encrypted data, thereby approximating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. 
Through these computations, privacy-preserving singular value decomposition is achieved.
